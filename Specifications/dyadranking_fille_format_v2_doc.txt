Synopsis:
Dyad ranking file format specification. This version is more in tune with the entity-relationship viewpoint of dyad ranking. Moreover, standard IO routines can be used to load dyad ranking data sets.

Elements of the dyad ranking file format:
# A dyad ranking data set consists of four files:
	- dyads file (mandatory)
	- ranking file with dyad orderings (mandatory)
	- X features file (optional)
	- Y features file (optional)
	
[Dyads File]
# Suffix: .dya
# Each line represents one dyad.
# A line has the following format:
Dyad_ID, X_Feat_ID, Y_Feat_ID

[Rankings File]
# Suffix: .dra
# Each line corresponds to one sample.
# A line has the following format:
Dyad_ID_1, Dyad_ID_2, ..., Dyad_ID_Mn

[Feature files]
# Suffix: csv or zipped csv
# Each line has the following columns
 Feat_ID, Feat1, Feat2, ..., Featp

Note: 
#1 An adoption of the SVM Lite format for  the feature files is also possible to enable sparse representation of features.
#2 If no features are available for the dyads, then X_Feat_ID and Y_Feat_ID in the dyads file are treated as Identifiers of the first and second dyad members.
