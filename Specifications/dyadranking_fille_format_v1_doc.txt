Elements of the dyad ranking file format:
# A dyad ranking data set can consist of three files:
	- ranking file (mandatory)
	- X features file (optional)
	- Y features file (optional)
	
Ranking files are specified by the following properties:
# Suffix: .dr, .drz (zipped dr).
# Each line represents one sample.
# A line has the following format:
XID1:YID1,XID2:YID2, ... ,XIDMn:YIDMn
which correspond to a dyad ranking:
(x_1,y_1) > (x_2,y_2) > ... > (x_Mn,y_Mn)
# A dyad is thus represented by two IDs that are joined together with the colon ":".
# Dyads are separated by comma ",".

Feature files are specified as follows:
# Suffix: csv or zipped csv
# Each line has the following columns
 Feat_ID, Feat1, Feat2, ..., Featp
