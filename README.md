# DyraLib - Dyad Ranking Software
**Dyad Ranking** is a problem setting within preference learning. It is about learning from and the prediction of preferences on feature vector pairs (called dyads). 

Implementations to the following dyad ranking models are provided: BilinPL, PLNet and LFPL.
Prototypical implementations with demoscripts and sample data are given in Matlab and Java code.
